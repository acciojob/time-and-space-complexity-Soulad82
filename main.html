	<h1> Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that quantifies the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the length of its input. It is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis, providing a way to understand how efficient an algorithm performs, especially as the size of the input data increases. </p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute and complete its task, as a function of the size of its input. It quantifies how memory usage grows as the input size increases. Space complexity is often expressed using O(n) notation</p>
